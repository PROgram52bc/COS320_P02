# Problem Description

It is a common practice for Christians to make Bible reading plans by dividing the Bible into a number of smaller chunks, and read each of those smaller chunks per day. 

The Bible is naturally splitted into chapters, and each chapter contains a variable number of verses. When making a plan, it is usually desirable to have the verses distributed across the days as evenly as possible (that is, we want to read approximately the same number of verses each day). However, when trying to distribute the verses into some $n$ days, we don't want to cut through the chapter boundaries.

To formulate the problem, given some $m$ ordered chapters with the corresponding number of verses $\{ V_1,...,V_m \}$ contained in each of them, and $n$ days ($m>=n$), we want to come up with a *plan* for those $n$ days, $\{ P_1,...,P_n \}$, where $P_i$ ($P_i>0$) is the number of chapters to be read on day $i$. The given plan $P$ must satisfy the constraint that 
$$(\sum_{i=1}^{n} P_i) = m$$
This also implies that chapters must be arranged in their original order (in other words, no reordering of the chapters are allowed). 

To penalize unevenly distributed verses, for each day $i$, we introduce a cost, $C_i$, that penalizes the amount of verses exceeding or falling short of the average $V_{avg}$. The cost for day $i$ can be defined as
$$C_i = ((\sum_{j=\nu_{i}}^{\nu_{i}+P_i-1} V_j) - V_{avg})^2$$
where $\nu_i$ is the first chapter planned to be read at day $i$, or, $\nu_i = (\sum_{k=1}^{i-1} P_k) + 1$, and $V_{avg}$ is the average amount of verses to be read per day. 

As a side note, theoretically, $V_{avg}$ can be calculated by dividing the number of verses by the number of days; however, to account for the fact that this average might not always be an integer, $V_{avg}$ is given in this problem as an integer that you can use directly.

So our objective in coming up with the plan $P$ is to minimize the total cost

$$C=\sum_{i=1}^n C_i$$

---

To further clarify the problem, let's look at an example. Suppose we want to make a plan that distributes $3$ chapters among $2$ days. Let the $3$ chapters contain $V_1=2$,$V_2=3$,and $V_3=1$ verses respectively. Then the average number of verses to be read per day is $V_{avg} = (2+3+1)/2 = 3$.

One possible plan for this setup is to assign $2$ chapters to day $1$ ($P_1 = 2$), and $1$ chapter to day $2$ ($P_2=1$). Then the cost of this plan would be $((2+3)-3)^2 + (1-3)^2 = 4+4 = 8$. 

However, there is a better alternative that assigns $1$ chapter to day $1$ ($P_1=1$), and $2$ chapters to day $2$ ($P_2=2$), with a cost of $(2-3)^2+((3+1)-3)^2 = 1+1 = 2$. And it turns out that the second plan has a minimum cost.


# Input

The first line of the input contains 3 space-separated positive integers, $m$, $n$, and $V_{avg}$.
Then comes $m$ lines, each line containing one positive integer $V_i$, describing the number of verses contained in the corresponding chapter.

# Output

The first line of output should be a single number, $C$, indicating the minimum total cost of a plan over the conditions described by the input. The next line should be empty.
Then there should follow $n$ lines, each with one positive integer $P_i$, indicating the number of chapters to be read on each day, that gives a total cost of $C$.
